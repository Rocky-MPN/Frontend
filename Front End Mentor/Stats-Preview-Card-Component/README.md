## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was a good experience. I feel I've made a progress since my last excercises.
I've learned to build projects using mobile-first approach and to use rem units arther than px.
Also I've found solution to background overlay (color on top of the picture) which worked really well.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.photo {
    width: 100%;
    min-height: 45vh;
    background-color: hsl(277, 64%, 61%);
    background-image: url('images/image-header-mobile.jpg');
    background-position: center;
    background-size: cover;
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-blend-mode: multiply;
    border-radius: 10px 10px 0 0;
}

```

### Continued development

In the future projects I will continue using flex, grid and rem units. 
I will also stick to mobile-first approach as this made teh work more effcient.

### Useful resources

- [Learn Grid](https://learncssgrid.com/) - This helped me with understanding the grid concept better.
